Note: If you want to use this algorithm on different applications you can use the watersolver() method in watersolve.py 
You will have to format your water bottles as follows:
You will have to have a list of water bottles as your input to watersolver()
Every water bottle is a list with information on its spaces (top of the water bottle will correspond to list index 0)

For example:
![WhatsApp GÃ¶rsel 2025-01-15 saat 20 05 05_60e14886](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0e41126-1a34-4352-9a3d-2457fccab498)

must be formmatted as follows:
[[1,1,2,2],[1,1,3,2],[3,3,3,2],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]] (Notice that same colors get the same integer value and empty spaces are donated with 0's)
